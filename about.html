Welcome to my somewhat sorted photo dump! ‚úåÔ∏è
<br>
<br>
All photos taken and edited by me. I've been taking photos on and off since 2018 and this is what I've come up with. My interest is somewhere around documentary-, street- or candid photography. Generally anything that is 'unposed'.
<br>
<br>
This page is also an attempt of getting my feet wet in some basic web developing. Next up: categories instead of a photo dump. HTML and CSS written by me. JS (Lightbox) by Lokesh Dhakar. Responsive for all devices ... most of the time. üôÉ
