    Sup! Hope you like my photos. This website is an attempt to getting my feet wet in some basic web design/development without any fancy templates.

  I'm mostly interested in street photography and documentary photography, or, to be less specific, unposed photography. No idea what it is, but there's something about spotting a subject, an interesting scenery, any kind of chance encounter and taking a photo that "works".
