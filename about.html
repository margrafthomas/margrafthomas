  <p>
This is the part where I'm supposed to talk about myself in the 3rd person.
<br>
<br>
What I like about photography is to look at pictures I shot months ago that I thought were good only to realize that they're not that good at all and how I would go about shooting them today.
<br>
<br>
I like that slight rush of adrenaline when wandering the streets without taking a halfway decent photo for HOURS only to come across a moment emerging right in front of me.
<br>
<br>
Been shooting since 2018.

<br>
Living in Berlin.
